### Hi there, I'm Ali

I'm an Applied Mathematics student with a strong passion for **AWS, cloud security, and software engineering**. I love building tools that combine **coding, security frameworks, and cloud technologies** to solve real-world problems.

**What I do:**
- Develop cloud and cloud security and automation tools using **Go** and **Java**.
- Explore and implement frameworks like **CIS Benchmarks** and **MITRE ATT&CK** to strengthen cloud security.
- Build efficient backend systems in Go and Java.

**What drives me:**
I enjoy **creating, learning, and building tools from scratch**â€”turning theory into powerful software that enhances security, reliability, and performance.
