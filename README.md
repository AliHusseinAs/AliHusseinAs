### Hi there, I'm Ali 👋

I'm a **Backend Software Developer** and **Mathematical Engineering** student at **Yıldız Technical University**.

I sit at the intersection of **Software Engineering**, **Cloud Security**, and **DevOps**. My focus isn't just on making things work, but making them **secure, scalable, and observable**. I love building tools that automate security compliance and optimizing distributed systems for performance.

---

### What I'm Working On
I specialize in building robust backend architectures and security automation tools using **Java** and **Go**.

* **Cloud Security Automation:** Building agentless scanners that audit **AWS IAM** configurations against **CIS Benchmarks** and **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques using **Go** and **Open Policy Agent (OPA)**.
* **High-Performance Backends:** Designing microservices with **Spring Boot** and **FastAPI**, utilizing **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous communication (reducing latency from 2s to <400ms) and **Redis** for caching.
* **Infrastructure & DevOps:** securing production environments with **Nginx Reverse Proxies**, containerizing applications with **Docker**, and managing cloud resources on **AWS (EC2, S3, IAM)**.
